            How I got my first job

            My first job was at a .NET shop. I knew a little bit of Visual Basic and I had heard of ASP.Net. No joke. When I was being interviewed at my first job I was asked "Is your .NET experience in WebForms or MVC?" I stared blankly and answered "Web...Forms...?" The interviewer looked back at me and said "That's exactly what we use here. When can you start?"

            My first job was at a .NET ship. I knew a little bit of Visual Basic and I had heard of ASP.Net. No joke. When I was being interviewed at my first job I was asked "Is your .NET experience in WebForms or MVC?" I stared blankly and answered "Web...Forms...?" The interviewer looked back at me and said "That's exactly what we use here. When can you start?"
          </p>
      
          <p>
            I left and bought a book called "30 Days to learn WebForms". I went through that entire book in 5 days.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            When I started that Monday I felt really good about myself. I walked into the office at 8:30am. A man asked me who I was. I told them I was a new hire. He looked skeptical and asked me if I was in the right place. I told him George had hired me last week. He said George wasn't here today and again asked me if I was sure I was in the right place. I told him I was. He looked at me for a few seconds and finally said "Okay. Good enough for me. Let's get you a computer."
          </p>
      
          <p>
            I was walked back into the a big cubical room and given my own little slice at a large connected desk. Another man walked me through setting up my computer. He checked the code for my project using Team Foundation Server. He opened up a file, it had over 50,000 lines of code in it. My heart sank. The man said "This should all look pretty standard to you."
          </p>
      
          <blockquote>
            "Oh my god. My college professors were right. The real world is really freaking hard."
          </blockquote>
      
          <p>
            My mind began to race. My heart was beating rapidly. "Oh my god. My college professors were right." I thought. "The real world is really freaking hard. There's probably every sorting algorthm implemented from scratch in here. I should have studied harder!"

            Little did I know that the file was generated by an ORM. No one could read that code.
