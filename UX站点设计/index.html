Usability is making sure things work well and are easy to use. Spoons, for example, are incredibly usable." - Steve Krug</strong><sup><a href="#3" class="citation">3</a></sup></p>

        <h2>User Experience (UX)</h2>
        <p>"User Experience Design (UXD, UED), Interaction Design (IxD), User Interface (UI) Design and other web/application design professionals use the term User Experience Design to refer to the judicious application of certain user-centered design practices, a highly contextual design mentality, and use of certain methods and techniques that are applied through process management to produce cohesive, predictable, and desirable effects in a specific person, or persona (archetype comprised of target audience habits and characteristics). All so that the affects produced meet the user's own goals and measures of success and enjoyment, as well as the objectives of the providing organization."<sup><a href="#13" class="citation">13</a></sup></p>
        <p>From the creation of high fidelity page mock-ups to decisions based on layout, colors, contrast, typography, spacing, and many other facets, Visual Designers work to provide the look, feel, and brand of a product.  Visual Designers work closely with Interaction Designers to perform usability and user interaction studies with customers and end-users.</p>
        <p>Interaction Designers (IxDs) study how users interact with and what their goals are when visiting our websites. IxDs attempt to establish benchmarks with products and examine areas of improvement.  They work with product stakeholders and customers to build goals related to product performance.  User Experience Developers also work closely with IxDs to examine the user interface (UI) and the ways various interfaces can be improved for the user.</p>

        </div>
        <p>While user experience covers all aspects of a customer's journey with a product or application, we work to provide customers who interact with our websites an easy and pleasing experience.  The core of our Digital Marketing team consists of User Experience Developers, User Experience (Visual) Designers, User Experience Interaction Designers, Digital Media Program Managers, and Email Marketing Specialists.  Each position has a specific set of skills that they contribute towards the overall customer experience with our websites and products.</p>
        <blockquote><p>"A bare bones development team for building professional web sites or software application for the web platform will typically, minimally, contain the following roles.</p>
            <li>Visual Designer (i.e., fonts, colors, spacing, emotion, visuals concepts & themes)</li>
            <li>UI/Interaction Designer/Information Architect (i.e., wireframes, specifying all user interactions and UI functionality, structuring information)</li>
            <li>Front-End Developer (i.e., writes code that runs in client/on device)</li>
            <li>Back-End Developer (i.e., writes code that runs on server)</li>
            <p>The roles are ordered according to overlapping skills. A front-end developer will typically have a good handle on UI/Interaction design as well as back-end development. It is not uncommon for team members to fill more than one role by taking on the responsibilities of an over-lapping role."<sup><a href="#5" class="citation">5</a></sup></p></blockquote>
        <p><strong>"Traditional marketing is failing. People are blind to advertising and have resorted to installing ad blockers. But they do listen to friends and family. Heck they listen to complete strangers before they listen to marketers.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Companies have to keep their customers happy. If they offer them a great experience they tell the world. But they will be just as quick to share bad experiences."</strong><sup><a href="#14" class="citation">14</a></sup></p>

        <p><strong>"If you make people think, you make them unhappy. Users don't want to treat your site or app like some sort of cryptic crossword – they want to know what they should do immediately and then do it. The more you make people think, the more likely they are to go elsewhere to get the job done." - Steve Krug</strong><sup><a href="#3" class="citation">3</a></sup></p>
        <p>"For the UX developer, the focus is on whether the interactions, process, flow, and overall experience of the application works for the end user. Is the application intuitive, simple (not simplistic) and, most importantly, does it meet the user's goals? Of course, the traditional developer is also concerned with whether or not the application works. However, for the traditional developer the application works if it executes all of the items listed in the functional specs. The focus of the traditional developer is centered on tasks rather than goals."<sup><a href="#7" class="citation">7</a></sup></p>
        <p>As User Experience (Front-end) Developers, we write the code that runs in the user's browser.  The languages we use include Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and Javascript (JS).  These form the "Holy Trinity" of front-end web development.</p>
        <p>You can think of it like this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML - The copy on the page and how the structure flows</li>
            <li>CSS - The styling of all elements on the page including colors, spacing, borders, etc.</li>
            <li>JS - The functionality and how things interact such as a piece of content showing/hiding based on a button click</li>
        </ul>
        <p><small>*Within our development team, we also have specialists in Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), a back-end language that runs on our servers.</small></p>
        <p>"Think of it a little like this: the back end developer is like the engineer who designs and creates the systems that make a city work (electricity, water and sewer, zoning, etc.), while the front end developer is the one who lays out the streets and makes sure everything is connected properly so people can live their lives (a simplified analogy, but you get the rough idea). They're also in charge of making sure that there are no errors or bugs on the front end, as well as making sure that the design appears as it's supposed to across various platforms and browsers."<sup><a href="#4" class="citation">4</a></sup></p>

        </div>
        <p>Although User Experience (Front-end) Developers focus on front-end languages to structure, style, and add functionality to websites while improving the overall customer experience, there are various other areas that we develop.  These practices and technologies include, but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Content Management Systems - Wordpress, Drupal</li>
            <li>Accessibility - providing equal opportunities for users with disabilities</li>
            <li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) - how Google ranks us in searches</li>
            <li>Responsive Web Design (RWD) - making a site or application look good across all devices</li>
            <li>Version Control - keeping our code in parity with other developers</li>
            <li>Application Interfaces (APIs) - code that allows multiple programs to talk to each other</li>
            <li>Task Runners - how tasks are defined and executed</li>
            <li>Build Tools & Bundlers - bundling and minifying code to decrease weight and increase performance</li>
            <li>Web & Browser Security - securing networks and connections to protect data and user systems</li>
        </ul>
